The first step in the renovation of the room will be to determine the type of work to be done during the renovation. After defining the guidelines, in the first phase, we can proceed to designing a new interior. The next step is shopping in a building materials store to buy the right products and tools that we will use during the renovation. Before starting the renovation, it will be necessary to protect those elements that are not renovated or do not want to destroy them. We enter the next phase in which we prepare the electrical installation, plaster and paint the walls. After wet works, we lay a new floor. After the dirty work is finished, we clean and prepare the room for arrangement. We arrange the room in accordance with the originally agreed arrangement. We are happy with the new interior ðŸ˜Š
